# This project is going to be insane with lots of fun.

The goal of this project is to test the various programming languages for networking.

We just built different servers written in golang , python , C++ and maybe some of the languages might be added later and then
tested each server's performance by considering the execution time taken by the respective server programs.

In order to not consider the network hop time we wrote a program in each server that will not focus on the time taken 
by network hops
