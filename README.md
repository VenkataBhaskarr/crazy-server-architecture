# This project is going to be insane with lots of fun.

The goal of this project is to test the various programming languages for networking.

We just built different servers written in golang , Rust, python , C++ and maybe some of the languages might be added later and then
tested each server how it is performing by considering the RoundTripTime taken by each request from client to each server

In order to miimize the effect of network hop time we wrote a program in each server that will significantly minimize the time taken 
by network hops
